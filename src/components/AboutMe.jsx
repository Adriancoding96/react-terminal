          Im a programmer from Stockholm Sweden. I started my programming
          journey 4 years ago when doing a college course for working with linux
          based systems and then we were required to build simple Python
          programs. I quickly fell in love with programming and applied for more
          advanced college courses. Since then i have aquired skills working in
          Java, SpringBoot, Rust, HTMl, CSS, JavaScript and REACT. My other big
          passion is cooking in which i have had a career in working in multiple
          michelin restaurants around stockholm. This experience has not only
          made me good att cooking but also showed me the importance of
          consistency and made me able to perform under hiugh amounts of
          pressure.
